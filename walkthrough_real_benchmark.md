# 🛠️ Real Engineering Benchmark Implementation

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. "Honest" FPS Meter (`src/utils/fps-meter.js`)
- **Real Tracking**: Implemented `FPSMeter` class that calculates FPS based on `performance.now()` and frame ticks.
- **Visual Feedback**: Updates color based on performance (Green > 45, Yellow < 45, Red < 30).
- **No More Fakes**: Removed the `setInterval` that was simulating FPS values.

### 2. Real Physics Engine (`src/generators/chaos-mode.js`)
- **Physics Loop**: Implemented a proper physics loop that calculates velocity and collision for every particle.
- **Rendering Loop**:
    - **DOM**: Updates `translate3d` for thousands of `<div>` elements, triggering real browser Layout/Composite work.
    - **Vector**: Updates a single `<path>` `d` attribute, leveraging SVG's optimized rendering pipeline.
- **Global Integration**: Exposed `ChaosMode` and `FPSMeter` to the global scope for easy access.

### 3. Application Logic (`src/app.js`)
- **Initialization**: `startChaosMode` now initializes the real `ChaosMode` instances with the correct container IDs (`dom-arena`, `vector-arena`).
- **Dynamic Control**: Particle count slider now correctly re-initializes the simulation with the selected count (default 2000).
- **Cleanup**: Removed the "fake" benchmark code and simplified the logic to rely on the real engines.

## 🧪 Verification Guide

### 1. Start Chaos Mode
- Click **"Start Chaos"**.
- Observe the **FPS counters**. They should now fluctuate based on real browser performance.
- **DOM**: Should drop significantly as particle count increases (e.g., < 30 FPS at 3000+ particles).
- **Vector**: Should remain high (close to 60 FPS) even at higher particle counts.

### 2. Check the Code
- Open DevTools -> Sources.
- Verify `src/utils/fps-meter.js` is loaded and running.
- Verify `src/generators/chaos-mode.js` is executing the `update` loop.

### 3. Stress Test
- Increase particle count to **10,000**.
- **DOM**: Expect severe lag (slideshow).
- **Vector**: Expect smooth or slightly reduced frame rate, but much better than DOM.
